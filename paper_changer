# This script will display a new background every few minutes.
# Put files in the dir $BKG_DIR. There is also the stipulation that
# you must use *.jpg files. There is no real reason for this other
# than convenience. You can change it if you want to.
#
# If you want to output the name of the background to anyting, there
# is a file called "now_display" that holds the name of the current 
# background; use this.

# WARNING: WHEN SELECTING WAIT TIMES, USE THE FOLLOWING:
# * ONLY USE POSITIVE INTEGERS
# * USE A LARGE NUMBER > 120
